This is a personal project to showcase my skills as a full stack developer.

The purpose of this website is to manage recipes and track what ingredients you have in your fridge. This repository contains the frontend of the application and is developed using React and Next.js.

The backend of the application can be found here: <a>https://github.com/JGladman/Cheffle-API<a>

There are many additional features planned that are outlined below:

1. Responsive Design (In progress)
2. User account creation
3. Deployment
4. Generating grocery list to make certain recipes that can be sent to phone using QR Code
5. Share and discover recipes with other users
6. More advanced filter and sorting options
